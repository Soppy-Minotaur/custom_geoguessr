This is a Geoguessr like game that lets you guess where custom geotagged photos were taken!

To set up, modify `config.py` to add the path to the folder containing all your photos by changing the variable `image_folder`.

To run, first install all required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Then, run the codes using `streamlit run my_geoguessr.py`.

Enjoy!
